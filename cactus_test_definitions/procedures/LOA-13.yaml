Description: Tracking import-limit through variable load
Category: DER
Classes:
  - DER-L

Criteria:
  checks:
    - type: all-steps-complete
      parameters: {}

Preconditions:
  checks:
    - type: end-device-contents
      parameters: {}
    - type: der-settings-contents
      parameters: {}
  actions:
    - type: set-comms-rate
      parameters:
        der_list_poll_seconds: 60
        derp_list_poll_seconds: 60
        mup_post_seconds: 60
    - type: create-der-control
      parameters:
        start: $(now)
        duration_seconds: 60
        opModExpLimW: $(setMaxW * 2)
    - type: create-der-control
      parameters:
        start: $(now + '1 minute')
        duration_seconds: 420
        opModExpLimW: $(setMaxW * 0.2)

Steps:

  # This test is purely following a sequence of DERControls. It's expected that the following events occurs out of band:
  # at t=0 - Test load is consuming 0W
  # at t=120s - Test load is consuming 10% of setMaxW
  # at t=300s - Test load is consuming 0W
  #
  # Validation MUST be performed by power meter to ensure that the DER is adjusting its power in response to changing 
  # loads
