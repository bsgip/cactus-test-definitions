      parameters:
        # Set this to a large value - we want to test they respond due to notification - not polling

Steps:
  # NOTE: This particular test definition heavily implies that a subscription is required but never sets it as a 
  # precondition / test procedure step. This test definition will treat the subscription creation as mandatory.
  #
  # Wait for a subscription to /edev/1/derp/1/derc and then add a DERControl in the near future
