# Cactus Test Definitions

This repo contains YAML test procedure definitions for use with the CSIP-AUS Client Test Harness.

This repo also provides Python dataclasses to make it easier for Python code to work with these definitions. In addition, there are also helper functions for creating valid instances of these dataclasses directly from the YAML test procedure definition files.
